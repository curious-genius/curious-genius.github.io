“If each step is 3 units, how many units after 4 loops?”

Rewrite mathematically:
3 × 4 = ___

Predict results before running code

✅ Assess:

Mental math

Use of math language

Pattern recognition

30–45 min | Robotics (Dash OR mBot)

🎯 Make coding physical and exciting

Activity: Robot Navigation Challenge

Move robot forward & turn using blocks

Use loops for repeated movements

Optional sensor intro (light / obstacle)

Challenge:

“Make the robot reach the target using the fewest instructions.”

🧠 Ask:

“What mistake caused the robot to overshoot?”

“Can you optimize your code?”

✅ Assess:

Cause & effect understanding

Debugging in real world

Engagement level

45–55 min | Intro to AI Thinking (Code.org AI / Pattern Logic)

🎯 Age-appropriate AI concept (NOT theory)

Activity:

Explain simply:

“AI looks for patterns and makes decisions.”

Use Code.org:

Pattern recognition activity

Simple decision-based logic

Example:

“If the object is X → do Y”

“What rule is the computer following?”

✅ No pressure — goal is conceptual exposure, not mastery

55–60 min | Reflection & Wrap-Up
Ask the student:

“What part did you enjoy most?”

“Was coding or robotics easier?”

“Would you like to build bigger projects?”

Instructor notes quick observations
🎤 Parent Summary (30–60 seconds)

Instructor Script:

“Your child shows strong logical thinking and did well with coding challenges.
We recommend starting with Coding + Robotics, supported by math reasoning.
This sets a strong foundation for AI and advanced projects.”
