        - "Story Sequencing as Algorithms – Put picture cards of a story in order, then act it out as a ‘program’ the class can follow."
        - "Robot Paths – Use Bee-Bots or similar robots with arrow buttons to reach a picture, then debug when the robot takes a wrong turn."
        - "Digital Drawing – Use a drawing app to create simple shape art and practice selecting tools, undoing mistakes, and saving work."
        - "Safe Online Adventures – Unplugged lesson on ‘Going Places Safely’ online: ask an adult, keep passwords secret, be kind."
        - "My First Mini-Program – Build a tiny animation in ScratchJr or Code.org where a character moves and celebrates; share with the class."

      band: "K–2 · CS Fundamentals"
      tags:
        - "Sequencing & loops"
        - "Events"
        - "Intro data"
      summary: "Students move from exploration to creation: writing simple programs with sequences and loops, and creating digital stories while deepening safe and kind technology habits."
      objectives:
        - "Operate a computer or tablet more independently: log in with support, open assigned apps, and navigate between simple windows or tabs."
        - "Write and follow algorithms with 3–5 clear steps for classroom tasks, games, and simple coding challenges."
        - "Create simple block-based programs that use sequences, events (when clicked/pressed), and introductory loops."
        - "Describe, in their own words, what a program is supposed to do and identify when it does not match their intent."
        - "Explain simple rules for safe online behavior and what personal information should not be shared."
      competencies:
        - "Technical fluency: improved mouse/trackpad control and beginning keyboard use (typing name and short words)."
        - "Computational thinking: decomposing a small problem (like drawing a picture or solving a maze) into ordered steps."
        - "Programming: using block-based tools (Code.org Course B or ScratchJr) to build scenes, animations, or tiny games with events and loops."
        - "Debugging: identifying where a set of instructions went wrong and adjusting steps one at a time."
        - "Digital citizenship: recognizing examples of kind vs. unkind digital behavior and practicing respectful language when commenting or sharing."
      workshops:
        - "Treasure Map Algorithms – Create and swap ‘treasure maps’ with arrow instructions; follow a partner’s algorithm and debug when needed."
        - "Loops Dance Party – Design a dance sequence on paper, then add a ‘repeat’ loop block in Code.org puzzles to perform it more efficiently."
        - "ScratchJr Talking Scenes – Build a two-character scene where each sprite moves and speaks when tapped, using event blocks."
        - "Mini-Game Challenge – As a class or in pairs, design a super-simple maze or obstacle game and implement it using basic blocks."
        - "Favorite Things Survey – Collect class data (e.g., favorite fruit), tally results, and view a simple bar chart created on the computer."
        - "Digital Citizens’ Pledge – Create and sign a class poster that lists technology rules: ask before going online, be kind, keep secrets safe."
